# Code-Refactor

Made Horiseon's website more accessible by:

- Making sure all links are functioning correctly
- Reworking the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors & properties
- Organizing selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
- Including comments before each element or section of the page
